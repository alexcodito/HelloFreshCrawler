### Notes

- The HelloFresh API provides extensive JSON metadata, including ingredients, nutrition, units and ratings. Storing this in a document database could enable useful applications such as:

  - Generating grocery lists from selected recipes
  - Advanced search criteria (e.g. total cooking time, calories, excluding/including ingredients etc.)
